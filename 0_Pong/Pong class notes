Pong class notes
Delta Time: one of the most important elements of a video time amount of time thats elapsed since the last frame of execution in our game
Velocity:
Hit boxes / box collision 
Lua is based on tables i.e. dictionaries in python 
Love is mostly for 2d                                        *great for prototyping
2d Coordinate System is the most fundamental way of looking at the game system in a 2d game
	Positive values are moving moving down and right
	negative values are moving up and left

love.load - used to initialize game state at the very beginning
love.update(dt) - very important takes in a funciton dt that is overwritten with your own behavior that changes the game based upon how much time has passed
love.draw - function that controls all drawing and rendering behavior
love.graphics.printf - draws on the screen takes text on teh screen and will draw the text at xy and will take in consideration the width of the screen. Can align text to the left, right, and center (think like word alignment)
Love.windo.setMode - takes parameters and sets up window that renders ont eh screen
Pong -1 - functions
	love.graphics.setDefaultFilter(min, mag) - everything that is in our application has a filter applied to it. Everytime we change the window size lua assumes we want the pixels to be smoothed to make them look less pixellated

	love.keypressed(key) - callback fuction expected in main that gets passed in a key that does an action based on what the key pressed is. Takes a string that defines the key so escape key is "escape"

	Texture filtering - 
		point filtering - nearest neighbor
		Anistroptic filtering causes blurriness in 2d

	var = require 'Library Name' - this is how we call in outside libraries or code or helper files 

	Virtual_width/height = sets a resolution for in game that is rendered in the arbitrary window size. low res feel for larger sized windows

	push:SetupScreen(virtual hw, Window hW) - library call that renders the game magnified at the actual windows size

Pong -2 - functions
	love.graphics.newfont - takes a new font ttl file and sizes that it loads into the program

	love.graphics.setfont - takes whatever font was set using new font and applies it to the active window

	Love.graphics.clear - accepts rgb colors and clears the screen in a color the last number tells it how opaque you want 255 full color

	love.graphics.rectangle - takes a mode (fill or line) x or y and a width and height drawing a rectangle at xy with width adn height

Pong -3 - functions
	love.keyboard.isDown(string) - returns true or false is string specified is pressed

Pon -4 - functions
	math.randomseed(num) - LUA only function, takes a starting number and spits out a random number (So how can we seed this with a random number so it doesn't spit out the same random number pattern)

	os.time() - Lua returns the time and changes every single second

	math.random(min,max) - returns a value inclusively [assumes min of 1 if not given]

	math.min(num1, num2) returns smaller of 2 values

	math.max(num1, num2) returns larger of two values

Pong -5- functions
	left off at 45 minutes
